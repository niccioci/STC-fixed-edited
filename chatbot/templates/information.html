            <p><strong>Project Title: Interacting with an investment assistant: online study.</strong></p>

            <br>

            <p>The purpose of this study is to inform the design of chatbot assistants. The expected duration of the study is about <strong>25 minutes</strong>.</p>

            <p>If you agree to participate, you will be asked to complete a series of computer-based tasks. There are two types of tasks available: <strong>(simulated) social trading/investment</strong> and <strong>image tagging</strong>. You can <strong>freely switch</strong> between the two tasks at any given time by clicking the button in the top right corner. There is a <strong>time limit</strong> of 20 minutes split into five 4-minute &quot;months&quot;, when the values of portfolios change.</p>

            <p>In the first part of the study, you will be asked a series of multiple choice questions about your attitudes towards using artificial intelligence. </p>
            
            <p>In the <strong>investment task</strong>, you will be shown 10 portfolios, their risk factor and how much their value changed in the last month. By following a portfolio, you decide to invest a sum of money and copy that person's investment strategy. To follow, unfollow, add or withdraw from portfolios, you will need to <strong>interact with an assistant</strong>. To decide who to invest on, you can get information from two sources: 1. the assistant <em>can</em> give you advice, if you ask; 2. you will see a <strong>newsfeed</strong> with predictions from external sources on how much portfolios are expected to change in the following month (on the right hand column of the page). Please note that the newsfeed and the assistant are independent of each other, and might provide contradicting advice.</p>

            <p>For both sources (chatbot and newsfeed), you will be able to examine whether each of their recommendations align with independent financial sources.</p>

            <p>In the <strong>image-tagging task</strong>, you are asked to guess three keywords that best describe an image (the keywords were generated by other users). There are 60 of these image tagging tasks available, and each successfully completed one earns you <strong>&pound;20.00</strong> in virtual money (so you can get up to &pound;1200 in virtual money from image tagging)</p>

            <br>
            
            <p>You start the activity with an available balance of <strong>&pound;1000.00</strong> in virtual money. At the end of the activity, you will be provided with an overview of how much virtual money you earned or lost each month. The sum of virtual money you achieve reflects your performance/score on both tasks, and you will get a bonus based on that, with each additional virtual &pound;200 that you gain worth an extra &pound;1 of bonus, up to a maximum of &pound;10.</p>

            <p>In the last part of the study, you will be asked a series of multiple choice questions about your experience of completing the tasks and using the agents which should not take more than a few minutes.</p>

            <p>There are no particular risks associated with your participation other than those associated with the use of standard computer equipment.</p>

            <h4>Data and Information.</h4>
            <p>All data will be handled according to the GDPR and will be kept anonymous. Only UCL researchers working with Dr. Enrico Costanza will analyse these data.</p>

            <p>Any information that is obtained in connection with this study and that can be identified with you will remain confidential and will be disclosed only with your permission or as required by law. The information collected during the experiment will be kept separately from your personal identity. The information will be collected and stored in a password-protected computer.</p>
            <br>

            <h4>Withdrawing from the Study.</h4>
            <p>If you decide you do not want the data to be recorded, or if you decide at a later date that you do not want these recordings to be kept in the form specified above, you may request that we delete the data from our dataset by contacting the principal investigator (e-mail e.costanza@ucl.ac.uk), within the next 20 days. After the next 20 days, any data will be fully anonymized (i.e. anything that may identify the data as yours will be removed) and may be made available to other researchers â€“ as this can be helpful for other researchers working on similar topics.</p>

            <p>You may withdraw at any time and for any reason during the study. You may access or withdraw your data at any time and for any reason within the next 20 days after the study ends when all the data is being anonymised or securely destroyed.</p>
            <br>

            <h4>Concerns or Complaints.</h4>
            <p>Should you have any concern or complaint, you can contact us at any point via Prolific messages or via email (N. Soh ucjunss@ucl.ac.uk or E. Costanza e.costanza@ucl.ac.uk).</p>

            <p>It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part. If you decide to take part you will be given this information sheet to keep and be asked to sign a consent form. If you decide to take part you are still free to withdraw at any time and without giving a reason. </p>
